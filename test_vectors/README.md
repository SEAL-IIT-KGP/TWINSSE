## Disjunctive (and CNF) Test Vectors

This directory contains the test vectors for disjunctive search and CNF experiments. All of these files are generated using the source files present (a Makefile is provided) in `database` directory of the respective experiment subdirectories (not the top-level `databases` directory). These files must be copied to the `test_vectors` directory of respective experiments, and the file paths (and parameters) should be accordingly updated in the configuration file and experiment source files.
