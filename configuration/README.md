# Parameter Configuration File
This file contains the parameter configuration file details that is read and used by the executables generated in the subprojects. A single configuration file contains the parameters for a single database configuration (including both plain and the corresponding meta-database).

## Configuration file layout

## Detailed specification

Each line contains a parameter value/string. Do not put whitespace. Try to avoid whitespaces in filepaths.

__Line 1__: _(string)_ Path to plain database file containing the inverted index of keyword and documents identifiers

__Line 2__: _(integer)_ Number of threads to use while processing (or executing any setup or search) over the plain database. The conjunctive and the DNF experiments use this value.

__Line 3__: _(integer)_ Number of unique keywords in the plain database. This is necessary for allocating memory.

__Line 4__: _(integer)_ Maximum number of document identifiers for a keyword in the plain database. This is necessary for allocating memory.

__Line 5__: _(integer)_ The size of the Bloom filter (number of addresses/elements) for the plain database. The conjunctive and the DNF experiments use this value. This a value which is a power of 2 just larger than the total number of unique keyword-id pair in the plain database.

__Line 6__: _(integer)_ Number of bits required to address the above Bloom filter. For example, if the Bloom filter size is $2^n$, then number of bits required to address is $n$.

__Line 7__: _(string)_ Path to the metakeyword database file containing the metakeywords and the associated document identifiers.

__Line 8__: _(integer)_ Number of threads to use while processing (while executing setup and search) metakeyword database. The disjunctive and the CNF experiments use this value

__Line 9__: _(integer)_ Number of metakeywords in the metakeyword database. This is necessary for allocating memory.

__Line 10__: _(integer)_ Maximum number of document identifiers for a metakeyword in the metakeyword database. This is necessary for allocating memory.

__Line 11__: _(integer)_ The size of the Bloom filter (number of addresses/elements) for the metakeyword database. The disjunctive and the CNF experiments use this value. This a value which is a power of 2 just larger than the total number of unique metakeyword-id pair in the metakeyword database.

__Line 12__: _(integer)_ Number of bits required to address the above Bloom filter. For example, if the Bloom filter size is $2^n$, then number of bits required to address is $n$.
